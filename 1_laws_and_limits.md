# PARALLEL COMPUTATION

Parallel computing means executing the problem in a concurrent manner, solving a single or multiple problem simultaneously to the same accurate result.

# **Parallel Computating Laws and Limitations**

## 1. AMDALH'S LAW

The speed up of parallel computing depends on the two factors 1. PARALLEL part and 2. SERALIZATION part. Mentions the limitation due to **bottle neck** issue on the parallel compuation i.e. limitation of serializing part.

## 2. GUSTAFSON'S LAW

Increasing the no of threads to solve a single problem won't speed up the task performance. Rather working on a single problem, increase the no of problem or size of that problem to maintain all parallel processing on multiple broken task to make huge problem smooth.
